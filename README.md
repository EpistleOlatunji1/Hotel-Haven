Conducted a Supervised machine learning , and created a model on how to detect customers that are likely to cancel after bookings have been made.
A comprehensive data analysis to understand booking patterns, identify cancellation factors, and develop strategies to improve customer retention
OBJECTIVES: Assist Hotel Haven in understanding challenges related to customer cancellations and provide data-driven insights to improve retention
Deliverables: Data cleaning and preparation, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) , Comprehensive data analysis (CDA),Feature engineering and model development, Model evaluation and fine-tuning
As part of evaluating our modelâ€™s predictive power, we calculated the ROC AUC score, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between bookings that are likely to be cancelled and those that are not.
Our model achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.96 (out of 1.00). this means the model can correctly differentiate between cancelled and non-cancelled bookings 96% of the time and This indicates very high performance in identifying risk of cancellations, even before they happen.
After oversampling and balancing your data, the model achieved 90% accuracy and a 0.96 ROC AUC, meaning it's highly effective at detecting likely cancellations.Solution: Integrate the model into the booking system to score each reservation and trigger interventions when risk is high.
